<h1 style="color:teal;"> About Me</h1>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;">My name is Jolie and I am a rising junior at Nathan Hale High School. I have two sisters and a goldendoodle. I really like bubble tea and if I could drink one drink for the rest of my life, that would be it. My family is from Taiwan and I am a first generation American. I am a competitive swimmer and I also play the piano.</p>
