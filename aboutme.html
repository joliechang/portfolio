<h1 style="color:teal;" >About Me</h1>


<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;">My name is Jolie and I am a rising junior at Nathan Hale High School. I have two sisters and a goldendoodle. I really like bubble tea and if I could drink one drink for the rest of my life, that would be it. My family is from Taiwan and I am a first generation American. I am part of my school's varsity swim team and track and field team. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and I first learned how to play piano when I was in 3rd grade. I also play the flute in my school's Wind Ensemble. My favorite subjects in school are math and science. </p>

<h3 style="color:teal;"> Fun Fact</h3>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> Last February, I had the experience of a lifetime and I was able to travel to Cuba with a few of my classmates. I was able to learn so much about the history of Cuba and communicate with locals from there. </p>
