<h1 style="color:teal;" >About Me</h1>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;">My name is Jolie and I am a rising junior at Nathan Hale High School. I have two sisters and a goldendoodle. I really like bubble tea and if I could drink one drink for the rest of my life, that would be it. My family is from Taiwan and I am a first generation immigrant. I am part of my school's varsity swim team and track and field team. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and I first learned how to play piano when I was in 3rd grade. I also play the flute in my school's Wind Ensemble. My favorite subjects in school are math and science. </p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">In my free time,</a> I go on youtube and watch buzzfeed, mukbang, and music videos. Some of my favorite videos on YouTube include the Worth It series featuring Steven Lim, Andrew Ilnyckyj, and cameraperson(Adam Bianchi) as they embark on their journey to various places in the world; trying foods at three drastically different price points, and comparing which one is the best experience,</p>
