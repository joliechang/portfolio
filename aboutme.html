<h1 style="color:teal;"> About Me</h1>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;">My name is Jolie and I am a rising junior at Nathan Hale High School. I have two sisters and a goldendoodle. I really like bubble tea and if I could drink one drink for the rest of my life, that would be it. My family is from Taiwan and I am a first generation American. I am part of my school's varsity swim team and track and field team. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and I first learned how to play piano when I was in 3rd grade. I also play the flute in my school's Wind Ensemble. My favorite subjects in school are math and science. </p>
